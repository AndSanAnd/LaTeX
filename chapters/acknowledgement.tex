First, I would like to thank those who contributed to the success of this work. I am very grateful for the dedication, guidance and expertise offered by my advisors Dr. Piedad Brox Jiménez, Dr. Elisenda Roca Moreno and Dr. Francisco V. Fernández Fernández. I have been able to learn a lot thanks to them.

Furthermore, I would also like to express my appreciation for my colleagues and friends Eros Camacho Ruiz, Pablo Sarazá Canflanca and Héctor Carrasco Lopez, who provided very helpful advice whenever I needed, as well as sharing their insight in this topic and providing a great environment to work in. 

Moreover, I would like to thank the University of Seville and its teachers for the opportunity to study in a field that I am truly passionate about and that I hope to keep working on.   

Last but not least I want to thank my mother, my sister, my girlfriend and my friends for supporting me during my studies and through this complicated year.
